## Learning objectives by day

### **Day 1: SQL fundamentals + JOINs proficiency**

**Session 1 (Warm-up - Feb 8):** ✅ Complete
- SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, LIMIT
- GROUP BY, HAVING
- COUNT(), AVG(), ROUND()
- Boolean filtering
- **Queries completed:** 7

**Session 2 (JOINs - Feb 9):** ✅ Complete
- INNER JOIN (matching rows only)
- LEFT JOIN (keep all from left table)
- Multiple JOINs (3-4 table chains)
- JOIN + aggregation patterns
- **Queries completed:** 9

**Key skills gained:**
- Basic SELECT syntax
- Filtering with WHERE
- Sorting and limiting results
- Connecting tables with JOINs
- Finding missing data (LEFT JOIN + WHERE IS NULL)
- Multi-table analysis

---

### **Day 2: Advanced aggregations + GROUP BY**

**Day 2 (AGGREGATION + GROUP BY - Feb 10):** ✅ Complete

**Topics:**
- Aggregate functions deep dive (COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX)
- GROUP BY single vs multiple columns
- HAVING clause (filter aggregated results)
- WHERE vs HAVING comparison
- CASE WHEN for categorization
- Multi-metric dashboard queries
- Regional/facility-level analysis

**Healthcare examples:**
- Cesarean rate by region
- Preterm birth rate by age group
- Facility performance metrics
- Insurance coverage analysis

- **Queries completed:** 6

---

### **Day 3: CASE statements + subqueries**

**Day 3 (CASE statements + subqueries - Feb 11-12):** ✅ Complete

**Topics:**
- Advanced CASE WHEN (nested conditions)
- CASE for calculated fields (risk scoring)
- Subqueries in WHERE clause
- Subqueries in SELECT clause
- Subqueries in FROM clause
- Correlated subqueries
- Date/time functions (EXTRACT, DATE_TRUNC, AGE)
- String functions (UPPER, LOWER, CONCAT, LIKE/ILIKE)

**Healthcare examples:**
- Risk categorization (low/medium/high)
- Composite risk scores (0-10 scale)
- Comparing to benchmarks (above/below average)
- Temporal analysis

- **Queries completed:** 4

---

### **Day 4-7: CTEs (Common table expressions & dbt-style transformations)**

**Day 4-5 (Common table expressions - Feb 12-14):** ✅ Complete
**Day 6-7 (dbt-style transformations - Feb 15):** ✅ Complete

**Topics:**
- Basic CTEs (WITH clause)
- Multiple CTEs (chaining logic)
- CTEs vs subqueries (when to use each)
- Recursive CTEs (optional/advanced)
- dbt-style layered approach (staging → marts)

**Why CTEs matter:**
- dbt uses CTEs extensively
- Makes complex queries readable
- Essential for analytics engineering
- Interview favorite topic

**Healthcare examples:**
- Multi-step calculations (staged transformations)
- Patient cohort analysis
- Benchmark comparisons with CTEs

- **Queries completed:** 5
